# 🌍 What is a CDN?

A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a **distributed network of servers** designed to **accelerate content delivery, enhance reliability, and optimize bandwidth usage**. Instead of serving users from a single origin server, a CDN caches and distributes content across multiple strategically located **edge servers** worldwide.

---

## **🚀 How Does a CDN Work?**

A CDN optimizes content delivery through **caching, smart routing, and traffic management**. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how a typical CDN functions:

1. **User Requests Content** → A user accesses a website (e.g., `example.com`).  
2. **DNS Resolution** → The request is sent to a **DNS resolver**, which determines the optimal CDN node based on factors such as:  
   - **Geographic proximity**  
   - **Server health & availability**  
   - **Network congestion**  
3. **Cache Lookup at the Edge Server**:
   - **Cache Hit** → If the requested content is cached at the nearest CDN node, it is served instantly.  
   - **Cache Miss** → If not cached, the CDN node retrieves the content from the **origin server**, caches it, and delivers it to the user.  
4. **Performance Optimizations** → The CDN may apply **compression, image resizing, and protocol optimizations** to reduce file size and speed up delivery.  
5. **Security & Traffic Filtering** → CDNs protect against **DDoS attacks, malicious bots, and unauthorized access** through firewalls and filtering rules.

## **💡 Benefits of Using a CDN**

| **Benefit** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| 🚀 **Faster Content Delivery** | Users receive content from the nearest server, reducing latency. |
| 🎯 **Load Balancing** | Traffic is distributed across multiple CDN nodes to prevent bottlenecks. |
| 🔒 **DDoS Protection** | CDNs absorb attack traffic before it reaches the origin server. |
| 💰 **Bandwidth Optimization** | Caching reduces the amount of data transferred from the origin. |

## **🛠 CDN Technology Stack**

Our CDN infrastructure follows a **hybrid cloud** approach, integrating **private servers with cloud services from multiple IDCs**. This architecture ensures **scalability, redundancy, and high availability**. Clients can manage their CDN resources through a **self-service portal**, while **Jenkins automates deployments and node synchronization**.

---

## **🌐 1. Networking**
- **Hybrid Cloud Deployment** → CDN nodes are hosted on both **private servers** and **cloud providers** to achieve global coverage.
- **Multi-ISP Connectivity with BGP** → Our private servers connect to multiple **ISPs using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**, enabling **dynamic routing and automatic failover**.
- **DNS-Based Load Balancing** → Traffic is **routed dynamically** based on:
  - **Server health** (determined via monitoring)
  - **Geographic proximity** (selecting the nearest node)
  - **Network congestion** (choosing an optimal path)

🔹 **Clients** manage their **IP pools, DNS configurations, and WAF rules** (blacklists, whitelists, rate limiting) through the **CDN dashboard**, which updates the routing and security settings in real-time.

### **🔗 Service Relationships**
```
User → Requests website → DNS Resolver → Nearest CDN Node
↳ (Traffic Routed via BGP) ↳ (Load Balancing Decisions)

Client → Updates DNS or WAF Rules → Changes Reflected in CDN Nodes
```

---

## **⚡ 2. Caching**
- **Redis-Based Edge Caching** → All CDN nodes use **Redis** to store frequently accessed content in memory.
- **Cache Management**:
  - **Content expiration (TTL-based purging)**
  - **Cache warming (pre-loading popular content)**
  - **Dynamic content bypass (avoiding cache for real-time updates)**

🔹 **Prometheus collects service metrics**, including **Redis performance**, to ensure efficient cache operations and identify potential bottlenecks.

### **🔗 Service Relationships**
```
CDN Node → Checks Redis Cache
↳ (Cache Hit) → Returns content immediately
↳ (Cache Miss) → Fetches content from Storage → Caches for future use
```

---

## **💾 3. Storage**
- **High-Speed SSDs** → Every CDN node is allocated **SSD storage** to optimize **file retrieval speeds**.
- **Distributed Virtual Machines (VMs)** → CDN nodes run as **VMs** on **private servers** and **cloud-based instances**, ensuring:
  - **High availability**
  - **Flexible scaling**
  - **Multi-region deployments**

🔹 **Jenkins is used to install and resynchronize CDN nodes**, ensuring that storage configurations remain consistent across new and existing deployments.

### **🔗 Service Relationships**
```
CDN Node → Retrieves Content from SSD → Stores for Quick Access
↳ (No Local Copy) → Requests from the Origin Server
```

---

## **🔒 4. Security**
Our CDN implements **multi-layered security** to protect against **DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and malicious traffic**.

### **Layer 4 (Network-Level Protection)**
- **Cloudflare Magic Firewall** → Some IPs are routed through **Cloudflare Magic Firewall** for **DDoS mitigation** and **packet filtering**.
- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS)** → Monitors network traffic to detect and block malicious activities.

### **Layer 7 (Application-Level Protection)**
- **iptables + ipsets** → Every CDN node includes:
  - **Rate-limiting rules** to prevent excessive requests.
  - **Blacklist rules** for blocking malicious IPs.
- **Custom Security Rules** → Dynamically updated based on detected threats.

🔹 **Clients can configure their WAF rules via the CDN dashboard**, modifying blacklists, whitelists, and rate limits in real-time.

### **🔗 Service Relationships**
```
User Request → Passes through Firewall & IDS/IPS
↳ (Allowed) → Forwarded to CDN Node
↳ (Blocked) → Dropped by Security Rules
Client → Updates WAF Rules → Changes Applied Across CDN Nodes
```

---

## **📊 5. Monitoring & Logging**
- **Prometheus** → Collects system metrics from CDN nodes, including:
  - **Application Metrics** → Web services, API endpoints.
  - **Service-Level Metrics** → Redis, caching layers, security rules.
  - **System Metrics** → CPU, memory, disk, and network performance.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** → Manages log aggregation and real-time request tracking.
- **Log Flow**:
  1. **Filebeat** → Installed on all nodes to collect logs.
  2. **Kafka** → Logs are sent to **Kafka clusters** based on node location.
  3. **Elasticsearch Cluster** → Aggregates and indexes log data for analysis.
- **Global Availability Monitoring** → We operate **12 monitoring nodes worldwide** to track **uptime and latency metrics**.

🔹 **Prometheus also collects real-time service metrics**, monitoring **Redis, WAF rules, DNS updates, and all critical CDN services**.

### **🔗 Service Relationships**
```
CDN Node → Sends Metrics to Prometheus
↳ (Application Metrics) → Web Services, Load Balancer, API Endpoints
↳ (Service Metrics) → Redis, Caching, Security Services
↳ (System Metrics) → CPU, Memory, Network Usage
Client → Accesses Dashboard → Views Real-Time Logs & Metrics
```

## **⚙️ 6. Orchestration & Deployment**
- **Kubernetes** → Manages all services, including:
  - **CDN Master Node** → Orchestrates CDN configurations.
  - **Web Services (CDN Dashboard)** → Provides an admin interface.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline** → **Jenkins + GitLab** for automated deployments.
  - **Jump Server** → Secure SSH access for administrators.
  - **Monitoring Stack** → Deploys **Prometheus, ELK, and alerting tools**.

🔹 **Jenkins is responsible for installing new CDN nodes, resynchronizing existing nodes, and managing rolling updates**.

### **🔗 Service Relationships**
```
GitLab Push → Jenkins CI/CD → Deploys to Kubernetes
↳ (Infrastructure Management) → Runs CDN Services
↳ (Service Scaling) → Auto-adjusts based on traffic
```
